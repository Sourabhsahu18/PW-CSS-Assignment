Absolute Positioning:

When an element is positioned absolutely, it is removed from the normal document flow.
It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor (if any), or the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
Absolute positioning ignores other elements and overlaps them.
Useful for creating overlays, tooltips, or positioning elements precisely



Relative Positioning:

Relative positioning does not remove the element from the normal flow.
It shifts the element from its original position based on specified offsets (top, right, bottom, left).
Other elements still occupy their original space, and the relative element affects their positioning.
Useful for minor adjustments within the document flow
